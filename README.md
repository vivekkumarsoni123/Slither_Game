It's a popular Snake Game which we used to play in our childhood. I developed the layout using HTML, used CSS for styling and wrote the logic and functions using javascript. Used localstorage to store the score and 
highscore of the player. Used the random function from math library of javascript to generate the coordinate of food that is yellow in color. Total play area is of 18*18 grid board and implemented alert message to 
apply the rules of game like collision with wall or the snake itself.
